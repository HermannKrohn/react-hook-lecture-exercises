# React Hooks

### Self Assessment 1
* Use `useState` to refactor the `App` component into a functional component
* comment out the componentDidMount for now

### Self Assessment 2
* Use `useEffect` to re-implement the componentDidMount logic (the fetch) into your app

### Self Assessment 3
* Define a new hook named `useCounter` in it's own file
    * Your new hook should use both `useState` and `useEffect` to implement the same functionality as your other hook useage. 
    * Your new hook should return an array with the current count as the first element and a function to increment the counter as the second element
